# Python Mini Projects 🎯

A collection of small Python projects created for learning, practice, and fun.  
Each project is self-contained and demonstrates different programming concepts such as user input, conditionals, loops, randomization, and basic game logic.

## 📂 Projects

### 1. Computer Quiz (`quiz_game.py`)
A simple interactive quiz that tests knowledge of computer hardware terms.  
- Demonstrates input handling and conditional logic.  
- Ends the game if the user answers incorrectly.  

### 2. Number Guessing Game (`number_guesser.py`)
Guess a random number within a user-defined range.  
- Uses randomization (`random.randint`).  
- Provides hints if the guess is too high or too low.  
- Validates user input to ensure only numbers are accepted.  

### 3. Rock, Paper, Scissors (`rock_paper_scissors.py`)
Play the classic game against the computer.  
- Tracks wins for both the user and computer.  
- Handles invalid input gracefully.  
- Continues until the user quits.  

### 4. Adventure Game (`choose_your_own_adventure.py`)
A text-based story where choices lead to different outcomes.  
- Branching story paths using `if/elif/else`.  
- Multiple endings depending on user decisions.  
- Simple storytelling combined with programming logic.
